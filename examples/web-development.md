# Web Development Examples

This document shows how to use `claude-task-plan` for various web development tasks.

## Example 1: User Authentication System

```bash
claude-task-plan "Implement JWT-based user authentication with login, register, and password reset"
```

**Expected Flow:**
1. **Clarification**: Claude asks about tech stack, security requirements, etc.
2. **Requirements**: Defines success criteria (secure login, password validation, etc.)
3. **Solution**: Selects agents (backend-architect, security-auditor, frontend-developer)
4. **Risk Assessment**: Identifies security risks and mitigation strategies
5. **Execution**: Implements authentication system step by step
6. **Verification**: Tests security, functionality, and user experience

## Example 2: Responsive Dashboard

```bash
claude-task-plan "Build a responsive admin dashboard with charts and real-time data"
```

**Key Agents Used:**
- `frontend-developer`: Creates React components and responsive layout
- `ui-ux-designer`: Designs user-friendly interface
- `backend-architect`: Sets up WebSocket connections for real-time data
- `performance-engineer`: Optimizes rendering and data loading

## Example 3: E-commerce Platform

```bash
claude-task-plan "Create an e-commerce product catalog with search, filters, and shopping cart"
```

**Complex Workflow:**
- Parallel development of frontend and backend components
- Database optimization for product search
- Payment integration with security auditing
- Performance testing and optimization

## Example 4: API Development

```bash
claude-task-plan "Design and implement RESTful API for a blog platform with CRUD operations"
```

**Process Highlights:**
- API design and documentation
- Database schema optimization
- Security implementation (authentication, authorization)
- Comprehensive testing strategy

## Tips for Web Development Tasks

1. **Be Specific**: Include technology preferences in your task description
2. **Security First**: Always mention security requirements for web applications
3. **Performance Matters**: Include performance expectations
4. **Mobile Responsive**: Specify if mobile support is needed
